  We discuss the general problem of coordinating diverse information
  types arising in genome-scale experiments.  S4 classes and
  methods are introduced and the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus
  is used to illustrate a strategy for managing microarray archives.
  The SummarizedExperiment class is reviewed for both in-memory
  and out-of-memory assay representations.  Methods for
  working with cloud-resident
  archives of DNA variants and multiomic experiments are presented.

# Introduction

Data management is often regarded as a specialized and tedious
dimension of scientific research.  Because failures of data management
are extremely costly in terms of resources and reputation, highly
reliable and efficient methods are essential.
Customary lab science practice of maintaining data
in spreadsheets is regarded as risky.  We want to add value
to data by making it easier to follow
reliable data management practices.

In Bioconductor, principles that guide software development are
applied in data management strategy.  High value accrues to
data structures that are modular and extensible.  Packaging
and version control protocols apply to data class definitions.
We will motivate and illustrate these ideas by giving examples
of transforming spreadsheets to semantically rich objects,
working with the NCBI GEO archive, dealing with families of
BAM and BED files, and using external storage to foster
coherent interfaces to large multiomic archives like TCGA.

# Coordinating information from diverse tables, gains from integration

## A demonstration package: tables from GSE5859Subset

GSE5859Subset is a package with expression data derived from
a study of genetics of gene expression.  Upon attachment and
loading of package data, we have three data elements:
```{r dogs}
library(GSE5859Subset)
data(GSE5859Subset)
dim(geneExpression)
dim(geneAnnotation)
dim(sampleInfo)
```

How are these entities (one matrix and two data frames) related?
```{r chkse}
all.equal(sampleInfo$filename, colnames(geneExpression))
all.equal(rownames(geneExpression), geneAnnotation$PROBEID)
```
Informally, we can think of `sampleInfo$filename` as a key
for joining, row by row, the sample information table with a _transposed
image_ of the gene expression table.  The `colnames` of the
gene expression matrix link the columns of that matrix to samples
enumerated in rows of `sampleInfo`.

Likewise, the `rownames` of `geneExpression` coincide exactly
with the `PROBEID` field of `geneAnnotation`.
```{r chktx}
options(digits=2)
cbind(sampleInfo[1:3,], colnames(geneExpression)[1:3], 
    t(geneExpression)[1:3,1:4])
```

## Binding the tables together in an ExpressionSet

The `ExpressionSet` container manages all this information
in one object.  To improve the visibility of nomenclature
for genes and samples, we improve the annotation for
the individual components.
```{r doan}
rownames(sampleInfo) = sampleInfo$filename
rownames(geneAnnotation) = geneAnnotation$PROBEID
```
Now we make the `ExpressionSet`.
```{r doexp}
library(Biobase)
es5859 = ExpressionSet(assayData=geneExpression)
pData(es5859) = sampleInfo
fData(es5859) = geneAnnotation
es5859
```

One of the nice things about this arrangement is that
we can easily select features using higher level
concepts annotated in the `fData` and `pData` components.
For example to obtain expression data for genes on the Y
chromosome only:
```{r dosel}
es5859[which(fData(es5859)$CHR=="chrY"),]
```

A more up-to-date approach to combining these table types
uses the `SummarizedExperiment` class, that we discuss below.

# GEO and GEOQuery for expression array archives

Data from all microarray experiments funded by USA National Institutes
of Health should be deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).
Bioconductor's `r Biocpkg("GEOquery")` package simplifies
harvesting of this archive.

## GEOmetadb

There are results of tens of thousands of experiments in GEO.
The `r Biocpkg("GEOmetadb")` includes tools to acquire and
query a SQLite database with extensive annotation of GEO contents.
The database retrieved in October 2017 was over 6 GB in size.
Thus we do not require that you use this package.  If you are
interested, the vignette is very thorough.  A view of the
`gse` table is given here:

```{r dogmd,fig=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
metadb()
```

## getGEO: obtaining the ExpressionSet for a GEO series

We have an especial interest in the genomics of glioblastoma
and have identified a paper (PMID 27746144) addressing a metabolic pathway
whose manipulation may enhance treatment development strategies.
Affymetrix Primeview arrays were used,
with quantifications available in GEO.  We use `getGEO`
to acquire an image of these data.
```{r dogetg, cache=TRUE}
library(GEOquery)
glioMA = getGEO("GSE78703")
glioMA[[1]]
```
